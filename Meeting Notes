4/10/18 Notes 

histWeather.csv - historical weather data starting 7/1/14-Sept 2017
locations.csv - cities, state, long, lat, airport code

4/17/18 Notes
Plan: -Merge forecast/locations with Historical Weather
      -Work on visualizations of just historical data (maps/variograms eventually
      with different points through time)
      -Visualization on standardized difference between actual and predicted 
      temperature
      -Visualization that explores the differences for different forecast lengths
      -Look into relationship between percent chance precip and actual precip

4/24/18 Notes & Questions:
1. Should we include days where the forecast date and actual date are the same? Or should we only keep days where the forecast is actually before the observed date?

Looking at how precip forecast percentages could be related to precip historical inches
leaflet - for mapping
tile plots
Tell a story!
Figure out where forecast are not working and use that as a starting point.

Including season in precipitation 
Side by side maps of prob precip and inches 
Matt: get the data 

Lisa: 50 % of area would be raining
Probability of it raining at all for any period of time during the day is 50%
See Wikipedia for actual definition used by national weather service

Do smaller cities have more extreme PoP values?

rnoaa hourly precipitation data only extends to January 1st, 2014. This is a super-annoying since our forecasts start in July, 2014 so rnoaa won't be helpful for getting hourly precipitation data.
It also occurred to me that precipitation might just ignore snowfall completely. We can investigate a city in the North to see what it's precipitation looks like in the winter.



5/7/18
Added some plots to explore whether or not precipitation forecasts get better over time.
Might consider adding similar plots for min and max temperature next time.

Possible Place to get data:

make line graph
look into this website to get hourly precipitation data.
