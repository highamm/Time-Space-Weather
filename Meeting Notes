4/17/18 Notes
Plan: -Merge forecast/locations with Historical Weather
      -Work on visualizations of just historical data (maps/variograms eventually
      with different points through time)
      -Visualization on standardized difference between actual and predicted 
      temperature
      -Visualization that explores the differences for different forecast lengths
      -Look into relationship between percent chance precip and actual precip

4/24/18 Notes & Questions:
1. Should we include days where the forecast date and actual date are the same? Or should we only keep days where the forecast is actually before the observed date?
