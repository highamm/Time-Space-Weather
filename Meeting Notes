4/10/18 Notes 

histWeather.csv - historical weather data starting 7/1/14-Sept 2017
locations.csv - cities, state, long, lat, airport code


Plan: -Merge forecast/locations with Historical Weather
      -Work on visualizations of just historical data (maps/variograms eventually
      with different points through time)
      -Visualization on standardized difference between actual and predicted 
      temperature
      -Visualization that explores the differences for different forecast lengths
