4/10/18 Notes 

histWeather.csv - historical weather data starting 7/1/14-Sept 2017
locations.csv - cities, state, long, lat, airport code

4/17/18 Notes
Plan: -Merge forecast/locations with Historical Weather
      -Work on visualizations of just historical data (maps/variograms eventually
      with different points through time)
      -Visualization on standardized difference between actual and predicted 
      temperature
      -Visualization that explores the differences for different forecast lengths
      -Look into relationship between percent chance precip and actual precip

4/24/18 Notes & Questions:
1. Should we include days where the forecast date and actual date are the same? Or should we only keep days where the forecast is actually before the observed date?



4/26/18 - Meeting with Charlotte 
ROpenSci 
https://www.weather.gov/ffc/pop
Looking at how precip forecast percentages could be related to precip historical inches
leaflet - for mapping
tile plots
Tell a story!
Figure out where forecast are not working and use that as a starting point.


5/1/18
Including season in precipitation 
Side by side maps of prob precip and inches 
Matt: get the data 

Lisa: 50 % of area would be raining
Probability of it raining at all for any period of time during the day is 50%
See Wikipedia for actual definition used by national weather service

Do smaller cities have more extreme PoP values?


5/3/18

rnoaa hourly precipitation data only extends to January 1st, 2014. This is a super-annoying since our forecasts start in July, 2014 so rnoaa won't be helpful for getting hourly precipitation data.
It also occurred to me that precipitation might just ignore snowfall completely. We can investigate a city in the North to see what it's precipitation looks like in the winter.



5/7/18
Added some plots to explore whether or not precipitation forecasts get better over time.
Might consider adding similar plots for min and max temperature next time.

Possible Place to get data:

make line graph
look into this website to get hourly precipitation data.

Airbnb Possibilities. Anything close to the convention center is super pricey

5/22/18

Do before Friday:
Erin - map for temperature errors 
Matt - temperature vs temp

look into overplotting fixes 

A couple of other random other directions we could possibly go in:

A "how good are the temperature forecasts for your city" graphic, in which we devise some metric to rank all of the cities in terms of how good their forecasts are, possibly for different seasons. The graphic might then be some sort of map, where, when you hover over a certain city, it displays its ranking or percentile for different seasons. 

A "can you construct a good prediction model for your city" app. In this one, I am imagining us building a basic prediction model for temperature using some of the 
variables in the historical weather data set (not really spending too much time on this and building one model for all of the cities). Then, we would have an app set up on our computer where the user would try to select some variables that he or she thinks would be important to his or her own city and see if their model beats our more general one (a simple way would be to build both models on a subset of the data and then test the model predictions on a test data set). 



6/27/18
Probably should keep only easy to find variables in weatherval response 
Matt - mixed effects predictions, 
Erin - location dist,


Poster:
Maps?
Models? 


7/2/18 Comments

Erin's comments/questions: 
  The plots used to assess distance and latitudinal distance are in the file Temp Error Maps.R    starting around line 271

  Doesn't look like distance plays a role in forecast error (visually)
  From the plots in Temp Error Maps.R (lines 357 and 356) do show the biasness 

  I also made leaflet maps where the size of the points is determined by the average squared      error (instead of the squared average error). Gives a sense of variation by city, but don't     see the bias issue.

  In line 139 of ExploringMaxTempErrorMods.R, the dataset forecastDiff is written. Do yoy know    where this dataset is created, doesn't seem like it's that script


Matt's Comments:

The lat/lon coordinates with airport codes provided to us in the locations data set were not accurate. I tried to fix that through using geocode again, but there were some issues. Distance is currently not accurate between the actual airport and the city center.
