4/17/18 Notes
Plan: -Merge forecast/locations with Historical Weather
      -Work on visualizations of just historical data (maps/variograms eventually
      with different points through time)
      -Visualization on standardized difference between actual and predicted 
      temperature
      -Visualization that explores the differences for different forecast lengths
      -Look into relationship between percent chance precip and actual precip
